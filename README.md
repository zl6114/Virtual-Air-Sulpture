# Virtual-Air-Sulpture
FYI Project of Zihan Liu from Imperial College London

## Project Idea:
Create a virtual object in the real world so you can touch and feel within a certain space via a device. 

## Main Difficulty of the project:
 1. The tracking system which tracks the positioning of the device. 
 2. The device which is holdable (e.g. a wind or glove), that respond and feedback from the virtual sculputure. 
 3. The VR space object modelling, mapping the real coordinate to the virtual coordinate. 
 
### 1. Brainstrom on the tracking system. 
 - Wireless Tracking   
 - Inertial Tracking
 - Camera Tracking
    - Leap Motion
    - MultiCamera System
 - Mechanical Tracking 
    - Mechanical Transmission 

 ### 2. The device which is holdable (e.g. a wind or glove), that respond and feedback from the virtual sculputure.
